# Palaeolithic Projectiles
This repository contains the data to perform the statistical analyses and produce the figures and tables for:

"Smith, G.M., Noack, E.S., Behrens, N.M., Ruebens, K., Street, M., Iovita, R. and Gaudzinski-Windheuser, S., 2020. When lithics hit bones: evaluating the potential of a multifaceted experimental protocol to illuminate Middle Palaeolithic weapon technology. Journal of Paleolithic Archaeology, 3(2), pp.126-156. https://doi.org/10.1007/s41982-020-00053-6".

This contains only code for analyses done in R; please bear in mind this was the first analysis using R so the code may be a little long in places; likewise some of the other analyses were not conducted in R. If you are interested in other data I can provide this on reasonable request.

If you have further comments or suggestions regarding the data and R code in this repository please feel free to contact me.
